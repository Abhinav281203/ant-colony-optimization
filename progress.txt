Got the result but progress still has variance, not learning?

best_distance_2 - 436.7926020383196
Increasing the exploitation percentage decreased variance in progress

best_distance_3 - 430.86061990557937
Setting the alpha and beta values from a distribution (alpha_mean - 1, beta_mean - 5) respectively
has significantly improved performance. progress has 0 variance and as good as the best plot.
reason unknown, premature convergence or global convergence?
