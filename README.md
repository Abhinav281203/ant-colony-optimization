## Ant Colony System for Traveling Salesman Problem

The Ant Colony System (ACS) for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a technique inspired by how real ants find the shortest paths to food. 
In this system, virtual ants explore different routes between cities, leaving behind a chemical trail called pheromones. 
Over time, better routes get stronger trails as more ants follow them, helping the system find the shortest overall path. 
The process involves a form of reinforcement learning (RL), where ants learn from their previous actions, updating their behavior to improve future decisions. 

The above is based on Marco Dorigo's paper, `Ant Colony System: A Cooperative Learning Approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem` (acs-ec97.pdf)
